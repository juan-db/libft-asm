# libft-asm

## Part 1

- ~~bzero~~
- ~~strcat~~
- ~~isalpha~~
- ~~isdigit~~
- ~~isalnum~~
- isascii
- ~~isprint~~
- toupper
- tolower
- ~~puts~~ (obviously, you can use the write syscall)

## Part 2

- ~~strlen~~
- memset
- memcpy
- strdup (obviously you are allowed to call malloc)

## Part 3

To conclude, you must code a ft_cat function which will take a file descriptor (for
example 0...) as argument and that will have the same behavior as the cat command itâ€™ll
return void.
